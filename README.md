How to executive the project
Once you run the sql script using Mysql database the super admin will be created. The super admin has the super privilege to create other users from admin the various employees. 

Furthermore,  the users(Super Admin, Admin, and Employees) interact with the application their is tracing mechanism tracing the users operations. This is made possible through session scope resource.
